Documentation
=============

This is where in depth documentation will be going. Right now it's just a placeholder.

The best we can do for you right now is direct you to the project's readme, or the sample app.

## Events, Highlighting, Custom Selectors, and More!

All of this and more can be done via the decorator api. Please check out the [decorator documentation](DECORATORS.md).

## TODO

Write and organize the documentation. Focus on customizability with real world senarios.
